Admin and User Role Management Dashboard

Project Overview:

The User Role and Profile Management System is a web-based application that facilitates user registration, authentication, and profile management. This project allows different user roles (admin and regular user) with distinct permissions to manage and update their profiles. Users can request permission changes, and admins can approve or deny these requests. The application includes user authentication, dynamic role-based access control, and profile management features such as editing details and uploading a profile picture.
Features
1. User Authentication:

    Login: Users can log in using their registered email and password.
    Sign-Up: New users can sign up by providing necessary details like name, email, password, and optional information such as address, mobile number, GitHub, LinkedIn, and profile picture.

2. Role and Permission Management:

    Admin Role: Admin users have enhanced privileges, such as managing user roles and approving requests from regular users.
    Regular Users: Users can request admin roles or permission changes (e.g., write access to their profile).
    Role-Based Access: Users have specific permissions such as "read" or "write" that determine whether they can modify their profiles or not.

3. Profile Management:

    Edit Profile: Users can update their name, email, address, mobile number, GitHub, and LinkedIn links.
    Profile Picture: Users can upload or change their profile picture during registration or via their profile settings.

4. Admin Dashboard:

    Admin users have access to an admin dashboard where they can view user requests, approve or deny changes, and manage user profiles.

5. File Upload:

    Profile picture upload is supported. Users can select an image from their local system, which is displayed as their profile picture.

Technology Stack:

    Frontend:
        HTML: Structuring the web pages.
        CSS: Styling and layout for responsive design.
        JavaScript: Logic for user authentication, form validation, profile management, and role-based features.
